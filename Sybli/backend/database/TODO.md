# Backend Implementation TODO

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Controllers
- [x] biometricController.js - Implemented comprehensive biometric verification endpoints
- [x] nftController.js - Already exists with basic functionality
- [x] daoController.js - Already exists with basic functionality

### Routes
- [x] biometricRoutes.js - Updated with all biometric endpoints and proper validation
- [x] nftRoutes.js - Updated with all NFT endpoints and proper validation
- [x] daoRoutes.js - Updated with all DAO endpoints and proper validation

### Services
- [x] biometricService.js - Implemented full biometric processing and analysis service using biometricUtils
- [x] hashingService.js - Enhanced with biometric hash generation and other crypto functions
- [x] nftService.js - Already exists with basic functionality
- [x] daoService.js - Already exists with basic functionality

### Utils
- [x] biometricUtils.js - Implemented comprehensive biometric processing utilities with multi-modal support (fingerprint, facial, behavioral, voice)

### Middleware
- [x] validationMiddleware.js - Added all required validation rules for new endpoints

### Server Configuration
- [x] server.js - Already includes all routes properly

## Pending Tasks ⏳

### Testing
- [ ] Test biometric endpoints with sample data
- [ ] Test NFT minting and transfer functionality
- [ ] Test DAO proposal creation and voting
- [ ] Integration testing across all services

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] Add Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
- [ ] Create endpoint usage examples

### Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for biometric endpoints
- [ ] Add biometric data encryption at rest
- [ ] Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

### Performance
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize biometric processing algorithms
- [ ] Database query optimization

### Monitoring
- [ ] Add health checks for biometric services
- [ ] Implement metrics collection
- [ ] Set up alerting for biometric failures

## Notes

- All controllers now export functions instead of class instances for better modularity
- Biometric service now uses biometricUtils for proper feature extraction and analysis
- biometricUtils.js includes comprehensive biometric processing with support for multiple modalities (fingerprint, facial, behavioral, voice)
- Validation middleware has been updated with all required validation rules
- Routes include proper authentication and validation middleware
- Server configuration already includes all route registrations

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with sample requests
2. Implement actual biometric feature extraction algorithms (current implementation uses simulated features)
3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Create API documentation
