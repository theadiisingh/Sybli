# Biometric Service Fixes - Completed Tasks

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Constants Import Structure
- **Problem**: `BIOMETRIC_TYPES` was being imported directly from constants, but the structure was `BIOMETRIC.TYPES`
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `biometricService.js`
  - `biometricUtils.js`
  - `biometricController.js`
  - `validationUtils.js`
- **Solution**: Changed imports to destructure `BIOMETRIC` and then set `BIOMETRIC_TYPES = BIOMETRIC.TYPES`

### 2. Pattern Normalization Error
- **Problem**: `BiometricUtils.normalizePattern` was failing because `patternType` parameter was undefined
- **Root Cause**: The `hashBiometricData` function in `biometricService.js` was calling `normalizePattern` without passing the `patternType`
- **Solution**: Updated `hashBiometricData` to pass the correct `patternType` to `normalizePattern`

### 3. Test Verification
- **All biometric service tests now pass**:
  - âœ… Facial pattern extraction working
  - âœ… Pattern quality: 0.9
  - âœ… Behavioral pattern extraction working
  - âœ… Biometric pattern hashing working
  - âœ… Pattern comparison working: true

## ðŸ“‹ Summary
The biometric service is now fully functional with proper pattern extraction, hashing, and comparison capabilities. All import issues have been resolved and the service can handle both facial and behavioral biometric patterns correctly.
